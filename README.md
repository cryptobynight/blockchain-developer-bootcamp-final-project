Project Idea:

I would like to build a website that allows users to upload any PDF document and mint as an NFT. My initial thought was to use this for Covid Vaccination Passes, but it could also be used for other sensitive documents. The NFT could then be sent to the travel authority, border control, or simply opened on MetaMask to display while being stored securely on the blockchain in a dedicated wallet.

The user could visit the site, upload the PDF, mint as NFT, send to personal wallet (or directly to required receipient). The user would also be advised how to burn the NFT if no longer required.
